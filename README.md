# Strict Writer Online  
Yes. This writer is very strict. If you are not typing any word for a specified time (in seconds), then everything would be deleted. 

## Introduction  
[Flowstate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flowstate/id1051600144?ls=1&mt=12) is a desktop writing tool online. This is forked from PeggyZWY/flowstate-webapp and being modified. This is completely free and you can use online to write. You can set the time (example 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min etc) you would like to write and the seconds to destroy everything you wrote. 
Then, you can start writing.   
  
* This is completely **free**  
* You just need a computer with internet connection. This works on **all devices**

You set your time. If you don't adhere, everything you wrote will be deleted. That is it.
